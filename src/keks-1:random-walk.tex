\section{Approximation of $\pi$ with cooked Spaghetti}

Consider a square with edges of length $L\in \field{R}_{\geq 0}$. If
we now consider cooked spaghetti of length $\ell \leq L$ and throw
this cooked spaghetti into the square. Assume this can be modeled as a
random walk of length $\ell$ from one endpoint of the spaghetti.

Can we approximate $\pi$ by the average number of intersections a
spaghetti has with the square.

\begin{proof}
  For more than ~100 steps, the probability distribution for the
  random walk to end at a specific point is a function of the distance
  to the origin. This is given by a Raylight distribution
  \begin{align}
    P(r)=\frac{2r}{N}\E^{-r^2/N}
  \end{align}
  here the step length was $1$.

  Assuming now that this step length is $\ell$, we get
  \begin{align}
    P(r)=\frac{2r}{N \ell}\E^{\frac{-r^2}{N \ell}}
  \end{align}
\end{proof}
